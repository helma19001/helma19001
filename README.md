I am a third-year Mathematics undergraduate student at Padjadjaran University. I have a keen interest in industrial mathematics, machine learning, and data analysis and have valuable experience in mathematical modeling, linear regression, data forecasting, and machine learning. I have developed my skills in programming languages such as C++ and Python alongside simulation tools like Maple. Personally, I'd love to use my communication skills to work with others to develop my professional skills. Now as a professional, I want to develop and use my skills in industry placement, especially in the data processing.
